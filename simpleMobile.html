        My name is Adam. I started last summer in  the Web and Mobile App Development program. So far I have taken  HTML/CSS, JavaScript and Java. This semester I am also taking Intro to Databases and Mobile App Development. 

        My goal with this program is to be able to support myself from my computer, with the ultimate goal of being able to be anywhere in the world at anytime, with the ultimate+ goal of traveling around with my camera. 

        I previously studied engineering and architecture as I love the mix of science and art. This is what led me to app development as I believe it contains both, and has room to incorporate previous studies.

   <p>I am attending this class to learn more about app development. And also because
      it is required.
