        <p>Revelation by Robert Frost</p>

        <p>We make ourselves a place apart<br> 
           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Behind lightwords that tease and flout,<br> 
           But oh, the agitated heart<br>
           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Till someone find us really out.<br>
        </p>

        <p>'Tis pity if the case require<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Or so we say) that in the end<br>
            We speak the literal to inspire<br> 
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The understanding of a friend.<br>
        </p>  
        <p>  
            But so with all, from babes that play<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At hide-and-seek to God afar,<br>
            So all who hide too well away<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Must speak and tell us there they are.
        </p>
